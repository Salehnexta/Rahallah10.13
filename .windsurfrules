Windsurf General Rules and Guidelines
Project Setup

Provide clear, detailed instructions in the todo.md file - Windsurf will follow them directly
Link to external documentation for specialized tools like LangChain or Chroma DB
Structure the project logically with clear folder organization from the start

Code Generation

Ask Windsurf to generate one component or feature at a time
Specify dependencies and versions explicitly to avoid compatibility issues
Provide system prompts for LLM agents exactly as you want them implemented
Request detailed comments for complex logic

Testing

Ask Windsurf to write tests alongside implementation code
Request test cases for specific user flows (e.g., Arabic user booking a flight)
Have Windsurf implement error handling from the beginning

Frontend

Provide clear UI mockups or detailed descriptions of the desired interface
Specify responsive design requirements explicitly
Request accessibility features if needed

Integration

Ask Windsurf to implement one integration point at a time
For complex integrations like DeepSeek, provide links to documentation
Request logging and troubleshooting code to help debug integration issues

Best Practices

Remind Windsurf to use environment variables for sensitive information
Request input validation and security measures
Ask for documentation of API endpoints

Review Process

Review code in logical chunks rather than all at once
Provide specific feedback on what to change rather than general comments
Request explanations for complex implementations to ensure understanding

Remember that Windsurf works best when given clear, specific instructions and can implement your Trip Planning Assistant most effectively when you provide detailed requirements upfront.
